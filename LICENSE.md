PolyForm Small Business License 1.0.0

Acceptance
In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree
to them as both strict obligations and conditions to all
your licenses.

Copyright License
The licensor grants you a copyright license for the software
to do everything you might do with the software that would
otherwise infringe the licensor’s copyright in it for any
permitted purpose. However, you may only distribute the
software according to Distribution License.

Distribution License
The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to
distribute copies of the software. Your license to
distribute covers distributing the software with changes and
without changes, and whether or not you distribute compiled
or uncompiled copies.

Small Business
You are in compliance with Small Business if your revenue is
less than 5,000,000 USD (five million United States dollars)
in the prior tax year. Revenue means the gross revenue of
you or your user, and all of its affiliates, from all
sources.

Notices
You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of
the software from you also gets a copy of these terms or the
URL for them above, as well as copies of any plain-text
notices of copyright, patent, or trademark, and any notices
that refer to these terms, in the software.

Patent License
The licensor grants you a patent license for the software
that covers patent claims the licensor can license, or
becomes able to license, that you would infringe by using the
software.

Noncommercial Purposes
Any use of the software for commercial purposes is subject to
the limits in Small Business. Commercial purpose means
redistributing the software for money, incorporating it into
paid products or services, using it to provide services for a
fee, or using it with the aim to make money. Uses not
expressly stated as commercial remain noncommercial.

Relicensing
You may not relicense the software under any other terms.
However, you may use the software as part of a larger work
with different terms, so long as you comply with this
license for the software.

No Liability
***As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without
any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be
liable to you for any damages arising out of these terms or
the use or nature of the software, under any kind of legal
claim.***

No Trademark License
This license does not grant you any right in the licensor’s
trademarks or any license to use those trademarks.

Termination
Your license ends automatically if you breach any of these
terms.

Defensive Termination
If you make any written claim that the software infringes or
contributes to infringement of any patent, your license for
the software ends automatically.

No Waiver
The licensor may not enforce some or all of these terms or
allow you to breach them. This will not be a waiver of any
other breach.

Severability
If any term is unenforceable as written, the parties will
reform it to the minimum extent necessary to make it
enforceable. The rest of the terms will remain in force.

Export Controls
If you use the software to do anything that requires a
license under export laws, you must secure that license
before doing so.
